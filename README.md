A soil investigation work was conducted at Shalimar, Howrah with fourteen (14) numbers of bore holes. The soil profile and characteristics were assessed by field and 
laboratory tests. 
Description of the Site: The selected site is located in Shibpur, which is close to the Indian Institute of Science and Technology i.e. IIEST (erstwhile B.E. College), 
at Howrah District of West Bengal. River Hooghly flows on its east and south side, IIEST is on its west side and Shalimar railway station is its northern side.
Selection of location of samples: Bore hole locations were selected within the zone of the proposed building towers. Total fourteen (14) number of boreholes 
were ex-amined, at various building tower locations for the entire site.
Procedure of undisturbed sample (UDS) collection: Key points of the procedure for collecting soil samples using a tube sampler are:

(i)	Applicability of Tube Sampling : the tube sampler is generally used for all soil types except clean sands and gravels, likely because these materials may not be cohesive enough to remain in the sampler.
(ii)	Preparation of Tube Sampler : a small amount of oil or grease inside and outside the sampler is applied to reduce friction. This ensures smoother inser-tion and withdrawal.
(iii)	Attachment and Positioning : the sampler is attached to boring rods and low-ered into the borehole or trial pit.
(iv)	Insertion Methods : the sampler is pushed into the soil by hand or using jack-ing. Alternatively, a 'monkey' (a driving weight) may be used to deliver blows and drive the sampler into the soil.
The procedure for soil sampling shall be carefully performed with an emphasis on preventing sample disturbance and maintaining moisture content. It outlines the following steps:

-	Monitoring Sampler Depth : to avoid excessive driving to prevent soil compres-sion.
-	Using an Over-Drive Space: this ensures the sample tube fills without damaging the sample
-	Shearing Off and Withdrawal: Rotating the sampler to shear the core before withdrawing it.
-	Trimming and Sealing : 
o	Trimming excess sample beyond the sampler
o	Removing the soil near the cutting edge (2.5 cm depth)
o	Sealing both ends with molten wax to preserve moisture and prevent disturb-ance during transport
-	Standards Compliance: Conducting sampling according to IS-2132.
